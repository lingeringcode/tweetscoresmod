searchTweets(q, filename, n = 200, oauth = "~/credentials",
  until = NULL, since_id = NULL, result_type = "recent",
  lang = NULL, sleep = 0.5, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{q}{search query to issue to Twitter. It can contain Boolean operators.}

\item{filename}{file where tweets will be stored (in json format)}

\item{n}{maximum number of tweets to be downloaded}

\item{oauth}{One of the following: either a list with details for an access token
(see example below), a folder where OAuth tokens are stored, or a csv file
with the format: consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_token_secret.}

\item{until}{limit for the most recent tweet. The function will then
returns tweets created before this date. Date should be formatted as
YYYY-MM-DD. Keep in mind that the search index has a 7-day limit}

\item{since_id}{id of the oldest tweet to be downloaded. Useful if, for
example, we're only interested in getting tweets sent after a certain
date.}

\item{result_type}{specifies the type of results you would prefer to
receive: "recent" (default), "popular" or "mixed".}

\item{lang}{restricts tweets to the given language (e.g. "es")}

will increase reliability of API calls; lower number will increase speed.}

\item{verbose}{If TRUE, provides additional output in console about API
rate limits}
}
\description{
\code{searchTweets} connects to the REST API of Twitter and returns
recent tweets (usually no more than 5-7 days old) based on a supplied
search string. Note that this function will not return all tweets. As
explained in the documentation (\url{https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/search}),
the goal of this API endpoint is relevance and not completeness.
